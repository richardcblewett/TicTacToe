Players will alternate turns, and whose turn it is will be displayed on the screen.
The outcome of the game should be communicated to the players.

create a class for the gameboard
- should have the gameboard populated when an instance is created
- should have a way to reset the gameboard

create a class for the two players
- should provide way to check and see if any of the moves won the game (i feel this would be better on the player than the gameboard)
